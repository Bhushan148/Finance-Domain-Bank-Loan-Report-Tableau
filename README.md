# 📊 Bank Loan Analysis Project Using Tableau

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to identify key trends, performance indicators, and risks associated with lending activities. Using **Tableau** for visualization and **SQL** for data manipulation, the project presents insights that help improve decision-making processes in managing a bank's loan portfolio. The dashboards showcase different aspects of loan performance and borrower profiles to highlight risk factors, profitability, and repayment behaviors.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to:
- **Analyze** bank loan data to gain insights into lending trends.
- **Identify** key performance indicators (KPIs) that reflect the overall health of the loan portfolio.
- **Evaluate** borrower performance based on factors like loan purpose, employment length, home ownership, etc.
- **Support** financial institutions in making data-driven decisions for better risk management and loan performance improvement.

## 📂 Tools & Technologies

- **Tableau**: For building interactive dashboards and data visualizations.
- **SQL**: For data extraction, transformation, and cleaning.
- **Excel**: Used for basic data manipulation and exploration.
- **PowerPoint**: Summarizes project insights in a professional presentation.

## 🔧 Project Steps

### 1. Data Import and Preparation
- **Data Source**: Bank loan dataset containing loan applications, borrower demographics, loan purposes, interest rates, repayment status, etc.
- **Data Cleaning**: SQL queries were used to clean the dataset, handle missing values, correct data types, remove duplicates, and filter important variables.
- **Integration with Tableau**: The cleaned dataset was imported into Tableau for analysis and visualization. Additional data transformation and refinement were performed within Tableau.

### 2. Dashboard 1: Summary Dashboard
This dashboard provides a high-level overview of key metrics related to the bank’s loan portfolio:
- **Total Loan Applications**: The number of applications received, displayed with Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) trends.
- **Total Funded Amount**: The total loan amount disbursed by the bank, with MoM and MTD comparisons.
- **Total Amount Received**: Total loan repayments received, showing MTD and MoM changes.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Average interest rate across loans, tracked over time.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Reflecting the financial health of borrowers, this metric is analyzed for trends over time.
- **Good Loan vs. Bad Loan KPIs**:
    - **Good Loan**: The percentage and count of ‘Good Loans’ (loans with healthy repayment), including total funded and received amounts.
    - **Bad Loan**: The percentage and count of ‘Bad Loans’ (loans with issues such as defaults), along with related amounts.
- **Loan Status Grid View**: A detailed table displaying key metrics segmented by loan status.

### 3. Dashboard 2: Overview Dashboard
This dashboard dives deeper into specific metrics, revealing patterns and trends across different dimensions:
- **Monthly Trends by Issue Date**: Trends in loan issuance over time, identifying peak periods and seasonal patterns.
- **Regional Analysis by State**: A geographic breakdown of loan activity and performance across various states.
- **Loan Term Analysis**: Segmenting loans by terms (short-term, medium-term, long-term) to understand default risks and repayment behaviors.
- **Employee Length Analysis**: Investigating the relationship between borrowers' employment lengths and loan performance.
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown**: Analyzing loans by their purposes (e.g., education, home improvement) to evaluate performance based on reasons for borrowing.
- **Home Ownership Analysis**: Understanding how homeownership status impacts loan approvals, defaults, and overall loan performance.

## 🔍 Key Insights from the Project

1. **Regional Disparities**: Some states showed a higher tendency toward loan defaults, indicating the need for region-specific lending strategies.
2. **Loan Term Risks**: Short-term loans generally had higher default rates compared to long-term loans.
3. **Employment Impact**: Borrowers with stable, long-term employment histories had significantly better repayment performance.
4. **Interest Rate Effects**: Higher interest rates were correlated with a greater likelihood of default, indicating a potential risk associated with high-rate lending.
5. **Loan Purpose**: Loans taken for certain purposes, such as education or home improvement, had better repayment behavior compared to others.
